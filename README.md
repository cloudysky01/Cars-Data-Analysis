🔍 Project Overview

This project is part of a broader learning series focused on real-time data analysis challenges. The dataset contains details about cars such as brand, model, mileage, engine type, transmission, fuel type, and more. Using **Python and Pandas**, the data is cleaned, analyzed, and visualized to discover trends and patterns that impact car pricing and performance.



🧠 Skills Demonstrated

- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Feature Selection and Filtering
- Grouping, Aggregation, and Sorting
- Conditional Filtering
- Data Visualization with Matplotlib/Seaborn
- Insight Extraction and Interpretation



## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python  
- **Environment**: Jupyter Notebook  
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn (optional)



📁 Dataset Features

The dataset includes:
- `Brand` and `Model`
- `Transmission` type
- `Fuel Type`
- `Mileage`, `Engine Size`, `Power`
- `Price`



📈 Visual Explorations

To make the analysis visually engaging and intuitive, the following plots are recommended:

- 🔹 **Bar plot**: Top 10 most frequent car brands
- 🔹 **Box plot**: Price distribution by fuel type
- 🔹 **Scatter plot**: Engine size vs. price
- 🔹 **Histogram**: Mileage distribution
- 🔹 **Pie chart**: Transmission types (Manual vs. Automatic)

These plots help visualize market trends and provide deeper insights into the data.



🚀 How to Run This Project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cloudysky01/cars-data-analysis.git
cd cars-data-analysis
jupyter notebook "Project 2 - Source Code.ipynb"

```
📊 Sample Insights
Which car brands dominate the dataset?

Is there a price gap between automatic and manual transmission cars?

What’s the typical mileage range for diesel cars?

How does engine power correlate with pricing?
